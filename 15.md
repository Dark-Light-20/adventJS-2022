# Challenge #15: Decorating the Christmas tree

<small>Medium</small>

A couple is putting up the Christmas tree. The boy loves Christmas decorations and wants it to be perfectly balanced. He has three types of decorations:

- Colored balls: <code>B</code>
- Small gifts: <code>R</code>
- Pine cones: <code>P</code>

The Christmas tree is a triangle that must be generated. They already have the base mounted, which would be the first row, and from there they have to **place the decorations upwards following a formula**.

```text
Place on top :    P     R     B     P
If below is  :   P P   B P   R P   B R
```

The combinations are also reversed. For example, if below is <code>B P</code>, above is <code>R</code>. But it will also be <code>R</code> if below is <code>P B</code>. Also if below you have repeated the letter, above you use the same letter. For example: if below is <code>B B</code>, above is <code>B</code>.

With these rules, we could see the tree that we would generate with the base <code>B P R P</code>:

```text
   R
  P B
 R B B
B P R P
```

Write a program that receives the string <code>B P R P</code> and returns an array with the representation of the tree.

```javascript
decorateTree('B P R P')
// [
// 'R',
// 'P B',
// 'R B B',
// 'B P R P'
// ]

decorateTree('B B') // ['B', 'B B']
```

Keep in mind that:

- The program always receives the text string that represents the base of the tree.
- The tree must be generated completely, that is, the base and the rows that are generated from it, until the top.
- You have to follow the formula to know which decoration to place in each position.
