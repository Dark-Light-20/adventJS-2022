# Challenge #22: The lights in sync

<small>Easy</small>

Verify that all independent sequences of Christmas lighting systems are in strictly increasing order. We have two arrays: <code>systemNames</code> and <code>stepNumbers</code>.

<code>systemNames</code> contains the names of the Christmas lighting systems, and <code>stepNumbers</code> contains the step numbers of each system.

We must verify that the <code>stepNumbers</code> of each system are in strictly increasing order. If this is true, return <code>true</code>; otherwise, return <code>false</code>.

For example:

```javascript
const systemNames = ["tree_1", "tree_2", "house", "tree_1", "tree_2", "house"]
const stepNumbers = [1, 33, 10, 2, 44, 20]

checkStepNumbers(systemNames, stepNumbers) // => true

// tree_1 has steps: [1, 2]
// tree_2 has steps: [33, 44]
// house has steps: [10, 20]

// true: The steps of each system are in strictly increasing order

checkStepNumbers(["tree_1", "tree_1", "house"], [2, 1, 10]) // => false

// tree_1 has steps: [2, 1]
// house has steps: [10]

// false: tree_1 has steps in decreasing order
```

Note that:

- The position of the system name in <code>systemNames</code> and the step number in <code>stepNumbers</code> correspond to the same system.
- The steps in <code>stepNumbers</code> can be repeated for different systems.
